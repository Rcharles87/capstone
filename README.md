### Instructions to run app Locally 

I have some pre-wrtitten scripts to make this process a lot easier. A friendly suggestion if you dont have postgresSQL please download from [here](https://www.postgresql.org/download/). After please change directory into the back-end folder and run

` npm install `

this will download eveything nessceary to be able to run the file. Afterwards run these scripts in this order to initalize and seed your data base 

``` npm run db:init ```

```npm run bd:seed```

And finally to start the server that can be checked in your local browser just run the script

```npm start```
